Old versions are on the [Sourceforge download page](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=90897>).
Look in the folder for the version and your operating system (or the source code if that's what you want).
The Windows installer is made with [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/) (the Inno Setup license requires giving credit).

New versions are only available in source form in Git, e.g. on [Gitlub](https://github.com/keithbowes/r3r.git).
